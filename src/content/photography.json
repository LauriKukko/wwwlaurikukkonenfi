    "I have been photographing since I was 15, and the spark for photography ignited early on while watching my grandfather with his SLR camera. I would observe him as he focused the image again and again, and the camera’s countless buttons, levers, and adjustment dials fascinated me deeply.",
    "As a teenager, I bought my first SLR camera, and during those years I shot a lot on film. The hobby then faded into the background for many years, until I rediscovered it through nature photography and portrait work while living in Vaasa.",

    "As a photographer, I am especially drawn to abstract subjects and light.",
    "I’m captivated by the lines that cut through an image, the wrinkles on people’s faces, and the worn, time‑weathered buildings that make me wonder what they must have looked like in their prime.",
    "Studio photography and portraits are perhaps closest to my heart, but in reality, I carry my camera with me almost everywhere — you never know when the light will fall just right.",
    "If you’re interested in modeling or getting new portfolio photos, feel free to reach out and let’s see if we can arrange a session!"
