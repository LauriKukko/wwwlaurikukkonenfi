    "I am a Finnish actor with an MA in Theatre Arts (Acting) from Tampere University, where I studied from 2006 to 2011. My career has been rooted in theatre, including long-term engagements at Hämeenlinna Theatre and Vaasa City Theatre between 2011 and 2019.",
    "As a performer, I am emotionally responsive and strongly impulse-driven, yet equally precise and attuned to rhythm. Comedy holds a special place in my craft—my master’s thesis focused on physical comedy—and I bring a natural sense of play, timing, and physical expressiveness to the stage.",
    "I am musically skilled, with training in both singing and dance, and I have further expanded my physical repertoire through stage combat training and have a background in acrobatics.",
    "At the heart of my work lies a deep commitment to ensemble collaboration. For me, the essence of acting is found in genuine connection —both with scene partners and with the audience.",
    "In addition to my theatre work, I have a strong affinity for camera acting. I value the same core principles on set as on stage: authentic connection with fellow actors, and a keen awareness of space, framing, precise timing and the relationship to the camera. I have appeared in several feature films as well as a number of commercial productions, and these are roles I continue to pursue actively alongside my current life situation."
